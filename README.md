## 🌟 What is NanoKVM?

NanoKVM is a series of compact, open-source IP-KVM devices. Built upon the LicheeRV Nano (RISC-V), NanoKVM allows you to remotely access and control computers as if you were sitting right in front of them – perfect for managing servers, embedded systems, or any headless machine.

## 📦 Product Family

We offer several NanoKVM versions to suit your needs:

* **NanoKVM-Cube Lite:** A barebones kit for DIY enthusiasts and enterprise users needing bulk deployment.
* **NanoKVM-Cube Full:** A complete package with a sleek case, accessories, and a pre-flashed system SD card. Ready to use out-of-the-box, ideal for individual users.
* **NanoKVM-PCIe:** A unique form factor with a PCIe bracket for internal chassis mounting, drawing power directly from a PCIe slot. And add optional WiFi and PoE functions.

### 🚀 NanoKVM-Pro: The 4K Powerhouse

Based on popular demand, we've upgraded NanoKVM to the **NanoKVM-Pro**:

* **Resolution Upgrade:** From 1080P to stunning **4K@30fps / 2K@60fps**.
* **Network Upgrade:** Blazing fast **GbE + PoE + WiFi 6** (up from 100M Ethernet).
* **Latency Upgrade:** Encoder accelerated latency reduced from 100-150ms to **50-100ms**.

## 🔩 Hardware Platform (NanoKVM Cube/PCIe)

NanoKVM is based on Sipeed [LicheeRV Nano](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/zh/lichee/RV_Nano/1_intro.html)，you can find specifications, schematics, and dimensional drawings [here](http://cn.dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/LICHEE/LicheeRV_Nano).

The NanoKVM Lite is constructed by the LicheeRV Nano and HDMItoCSI board, and the NanoKVM FULL adds the NanoKVM-A/B board and shell to the NanoKVM Lite. The HDMItoCSI board is used to convert the HDMI signal; NanoKVM-A, including OLED, ATX control output (USB Type-C interface), auxiliary power supply and ATX power on/off and reset buttons; The NanoKVM-B is connected to the plate at one end and the computer at the other end is connected to the computer ATX-Pin, which is used to remotely control the power of the computer.

The NanoKVM image is built on LicheeRV Nano SDK and MaixCDK, and is compatible with materials that use the LicheeRV Nano, opposite the KVM software cannot be used with the LicheeRV Nano or other SG2002 products. If you would like to build an HDMI input application on LicheeRV Nano or MaixCam, please contact us for technical support.

Note: Out of the 256MB memory in SG2002, 158MB is currently allocated for the multimedia subsystem, which NanoKVM will use for video image acquisition and processing.
