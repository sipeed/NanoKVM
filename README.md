## 🌟 What is NanoKVM?

NanoKVM is a series of compact, open-source IP-KVM devices based on the LicheeRV Nano (RISC-V). NanoKVM allows you to remotely access and control computers as if you were sitting right in front of them – perfect for managing servers, embedded systems, or any headless machine.

## 📦 Product Family

We offer several NanoKVM versions to suit your needs:

* **NanoKVM-Cube Lite:** A barebones kit for DIY enthusiasts and enterprise users requiring bulk deployment.
* **NanoKVM-Cube Full:** A complete package featuring a sleek case, accessories, and a pre-flashed system SD card. Ready to use out-of-the-box; ideal for individual users.
* **NanoKVM-PCIe:** A unique form factor with a PCIe bracket for internal chassis mounting. It draws power directly from the PCIe slot and supports optional WiFi and PoE functions.
* **[NanoKVM-Pro:](https://github.com/sipeed/NanoKVM-Pro)** Based on popular demand, the **Pro version** delivers significant performance upgrades:
  * **Resolution:** Upgraded from 1080P to stunning **4K@30fps / 2K@60fps**.
  * **Network:** Blazing fast **1Gbps Ethernet + PoE + WiFi 6** ((upgraded from 100Mbps).
  * **Latency:** Encoder accelerated latency reduced from 100-150ms to **50-100ms**.

### EDID Editor Tool

NanoKVM includes an EDID (Extended Display Identification Data) editor tool that allows you to customize the display capabilities reported to the connected host system. This is useful for:
- Supporting resolutions not detected automatically
- Fixing display compatibility issues
- Setting custom refresh rates

**Usage:**

1. SSH into your NanoKVM device
2. Navigate to the tools directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/NanoKVM/tools/nanokvm_update_edid
   ```

3. Compile the tool (if not already compiled):
   ```bash
   make
   ```

4. Run the EDID editor with your EDID binary file:
   ```bash
   ./nanokvm_update_edid /path/to/your_edid.bin
   ```

**Built-in Template:**

A pre-configured 1080P EDID template is included:
- `E21_NanoKVM.bin` - Standard 1080P EDID (256 bytes)

**Creating Custom EDID:**

You can create custom EDID files using various tools:
- [Linux EDID Generator](https://github.com/fakrul/edid-generator)
- [EDID Editor (Windows)](https://www.entechtaiwan.com/tools/edid-editor)
- [AW EDID Editor](http://www.tawbware.com/edid/awedin.html)

**Important Notes:**
- EDID data must be exactly 256 bytes
- Invalid EDID data may cause display issues
- For Cube/Lite hardware versions, you **must manually power cycle the device** after updating EDID
- For PCIe version, EDID changes apply automatically without power cycling

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Compile the tool
cd /path/to/NanoKVM/tools/nanokvm_update_edid
make

# 2. Use built-in 1080P template or provide your custom EDID
./nanokvm_update_edid E21_NanoKVM.bin

# 3. Or use a custom EDID file you created
./nanokvm_update_edid /path/to/custom_1080p_edid.bin
```

## 🔩 Hardware Platform (NanoKVM Cube/PCIe)

NanoKVM is based on Sipeed [LicheeRV Nano](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/zh/lichee/RV_Nano/1_intro.html). You can find specifications, schematics, and dimensional drawings in the [download station](http://cn.dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/LICHEE/LicheeRV_Nano).

The NanoKVM Lite is constructed by the LicheeRV Nano and HDMItoCSI board, and the NanoKVM FULL adds the NanoKVM-A/B board and shell to the NanoKVM Lite. The HDMItoCSI board is used to convert the HDMI signal; NanoKVM-A, including OLED, ATX control output (USB Type-C interface), auxiliary power supply and ATX power on/off and reset buttons; The NanoKVM-B is connected to the plate at one end and the computer at the other end is connected to the computer ATX-Pin, which is used to remotely control the power of the computer.

The NanoKVM image is built on LicheeRV Nano SDK and MaixCDK, and is compatible with materials that use the LicheeRV Nano, opposite the KVM software cannot be used with the LicheeRV Nano or other SG2002 products. If you would like to build an HDMI input application on LicheeRV Nano or MaixCam, please contact us for technical support.

Note: Out of the 256MB memory in SG2002, 158MB is currently allocated for the multimedia subsystem, which NanoKVM will use for video image acquisition and processing.
